# Angular2 Lay Load Demo

It's a sample repository to explain how to lazy module loading in your Angular2 App with webpack2.

This repository includes JiT(Just in Time) and AoT(Ahead of Time) demos.
The AoT demo uses `ngc`([angular/compiler-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/modules/%40angular/compiler-cli/README.md)).

npm i
npm run build
npm start
```
